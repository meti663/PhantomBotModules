#What Is This?
These are custom modules that I have built for PhantomBot.  You have to install PhantomBot to get these to work.  You can find the bot at https://phantombot.tv/ and instructions to install the bot.  Once installed, you will need to copy over the the module files and folder structure to ./scripts/ located in the phantombot root folder.  

Example: <br/>

custom/quizHandler.js --> ./scripts/custom/quizHandler.js <br/>
lang/custom/custom-quizHandler.js --> ./scripts/lang/custom/custom-quizHandler.js

#The Quiz Handler module
REQUIRES <br/>

custom/quizHandler.js <br/>
lang/custom/custom-quizHandler.js <br/>

#The Extra Life System Module
REQUIRES <br/>

custom/ExtraLifeSystem.js <br/>
lang/custom/custom-extraLifeSystem.js <br/>
